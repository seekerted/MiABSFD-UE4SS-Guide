Installing UE4SS Download UE4SS v3.0.0 . Make a backup of the game's executable folder ( \\steamapps\\common\\MadeInAbyss-BSFD\\MadeInAbyss-BSFD\\Binaries\\Win64 ). This is so that you can revert the game back to a clean slate in case something happens. Extract the zip into the executable folder . UE4SS should now be installed whenever you run the game. To uninstall, revert the executable folder back to its clean slate. See the sidebar for more info on UE4SS and its features. Guides Once you've installed UE4SS, you can check out the guides on the sidebar on the left. While they are still WIP, if you're an advanced enough user, installation should be enough, and you can start experimenting by looking at guides from the UE4SS docs and their Discord server (also linked in the docs).
